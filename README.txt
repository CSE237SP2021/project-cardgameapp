Iteration 1:
# The user stories that were completed this iteration were creation of a Card class, creation of a Deck class, implimentation of a Shuffle method, implimentation of a Draw Card method, and

Next iteration we intend to complete the framework for the War card game, we intend to complete the framework for the Blackjack game, and we intent to implement JUnit tests for both games

The in-progress pieces such as the blackjack framework does not currently function but is close to complete.  It is not technically "implemeted" yet, but we have all discussed it a lot and have a good idea of where to go with it

For the first iteration we planned to finish a large portion of the Java code and then for iteration two focus on integration with the command line, so currently we dont have a command line command to acccess our Java code, but if the Main method for our source file is run you can see a demonstration of how some of our methods work.

Iteration 2:

You can locate our code for iteration 2 in our development branch. We received feedback last iteration to only work in our development branch and merge into master the least amount possible.

What user stories were completed this iteration?
  The User stories we completed this iteration were completed were user can access the application through the command line, the framework for the Blackjack game, and the framework for the war game. 
  
What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
  The User stories we want to compllete for next iteration are finish and polish UI for war, finish and polish UI for blackjack, creat game "make 21", and create leaderboard for players.
  
Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
  We have implemented most of the interface for both blackjack and war but both are not fully functional in the commandline yet. This is part of what we intend to complete next iteration. 
  
What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
  
You can run our program by cloning our master branch, finding it in on your computer through the terminal, and running ./cardgameapp.sh on the command line.
 
Iteration 3: 

What user stories were completed this iteration?

The user stories completed this iteration were finish the War game, finish the Blackjack game, create a leaderboard for players, and play make 21. 

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

There is nothing that is not implemented yet.
