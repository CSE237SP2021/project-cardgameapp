The user stories that were completed this iteration were creation of a Card class, creation of a Deck class, implimentation of a Shuffle method, implimentation of a Draw Card method, and

Next iteration we intend to complete the framework for the War card game, we intend to complete the framework for the Blackjack game, and we intent to implement JUnit tests for both games

The in-progress pieces such as the blackjack framework does not currently function but is close to complete.  It is not technically "implemeted" yet, but we have all discussed it a lot and have a good idea of where to go with it

For the first iteration we planned to finish a large portion of the Java code and then for iteration two focus on integration with the command line, so currently we dont have a command line command to acccess our Java code, but if the Main method for our source file is run you can see a demonstration of how some of our methods work.
